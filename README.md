## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to use the published Citi Bike Data to analyze the bike usage pattern, such as gender differences, durations, peak hours, etc. The analytical results will be carefully applied to Des Monies, where new business development is desired. 


## Results
### Trip duration: Trip duraton results tell us the majority of the people will use rented citibike for a trip around 3 to 10 hours, with the peak duration of 5 hours. 
### Trip duration by genders: if breakdown the tripduration analysis by genders, the conclusion remains the same ( there is no significant differences in genders as how long each gender will use the bike). Both male and female users sees the peak duration at 4 to 5 hours. 
### Weekday per hour analysis: the analysis shows that people like to rent the bikes on weekdays 7am -9am and 5pm-6pm. These are peak hours where most people needs to commute from home to work and vice versa. While during weekends, the usage is mostly spreaded during the daytime, with 11am to 12 pm as the peak hour. 
### Weekday per hour breakdown by gender: There is no different pattern observed based on genders( male and female users shows the same patter in terms of peak hours of weekday and weekends). 
### User Trips by Gender: Customer vesus subscriber,subscrider tend to use bikes way more then customers. Male subscriber shows more usage than female subscriber. Wile customers(non-subscirbers shows no gender differences). Subscriber is more likely to reveal actualy gender information as versus to customers (more unknown gender users are customers instead of subscribers). 
### Gender analysis (module not chanllenge?? among all the users, males are dominant. 
### August peak hours( module not challenge) during august (summer time), peak hours (start time) shows between 5 to 6 pm. This maybe people are off work and like to rent a bike to travel around the city. 

## Summary
The NYC citi bike data analysis gives us a very good general idea as when, who where and how long people would like use rented bikes. In order to apply the the analysis to Des Monies, it is better to keep on looking into the data, for example what is the average travel distance ( we can use start station and stop station information for this analysis. Also we can look into the maintainence cost per bike so it can help us to understand the profits of the business more.
